In this homework assignment, you will complete the following tasks:

1. Complete a notebook of rental analysis

2. Create a dashboard of interactive visualizations to explore the market data

### Rental Analysis

The first step to building the dashboard is to work out all of the calculations and visualizations in an analysis notebook. Once the code is worked out here, it can be copied over to a dashboard code and used with Panel to create the final layout. Use the `rental_analysis.ipynb` to complete the following:

### Dashboard

Now that you have worked out all of the code and analysis, you will use the Panel library to build an interactive dashboard for all of the visualizations. There are no hard requirements for the layout of this dashboard, so use your own imagination and creativity!
